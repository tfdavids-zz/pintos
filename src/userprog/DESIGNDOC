Argument passing was implemented by passing a new parameter, void *aux, to the
function load(), which loads a new process in memory. The first input to
load(), const char *cmdline, is the name of the function being called (without
arguments), and the last input, void *aux, is the full name, including
arguments. This string is parsed in the function setup_args(), which decrements
the stack pointer as much as necessary to set up the stack properly. We ensure
that the elements of argv[] are in the right order by initializing argv[] at
the proper location on the stack, and then reading the addresses of the
arguments, which are already on the stack, to populate argv[]. We avoid
overflowing the stack page by limiting the length of the args[] array to one
page.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok_r() is the reentrant version of strtok(). If a timer interrupt occurred
while we were parsing the arguments, strtok()'s output could be corrupted;
however, strtok_r() will still return the correct output.

In the Pintos approach, we allocate an entirely new page for the copy of the
command string, which is then freed when the new thread is loaded. Separating
the command in the shell would avoid the need to do this, since we would not
need a copy of the command for the arguments.

The Unix approach also has the advantage that it knows earlier which command is
actually called. In the Pintos approach, we just take the command as a raw
string all the way back to the kernel, which could cause problems if it has an
incorrect number of arguments, for example. However, if we were to follow the
Unix approach and parse the command and arguments in the shell, we could check
earlier for a possible error in the command, or for something more sinister
such as a security attack.

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
